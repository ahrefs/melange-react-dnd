# Melange bindings for react-dnd

[Melange](https://melange.re) bindings for [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd).

## Status

ðŸš§ Not everything is supported yet; Unstable; Doesn't follow semver; ðŸš§

Feel free to create an issue or PR.

## Install

Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager.

Then:

The bindings support the following versions of the `react-dnd` and `react-dnd-html5-backend`
npm packages, which should be installed separately, together with `react` and `react-dom`:

    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dnd": "^14.0.3",
		"react-dnd-html5-backend": "^14.0.1"
  }
```

# Setup

Add `melange-react-dnd` to the `libraries` in your `dune` file:

```dune
